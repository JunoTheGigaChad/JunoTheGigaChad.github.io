<h1> Theropod research! By Juno! :D <h1>
	  
	  <p> 		Theropods are named after the Ancient Greek word thēríon which means ‘wild beast’. Theropods are dinosaurs with hollow bones, three toes, 
	  and claws on each limb. Generally they are classified as a group of Saurischian dinosaurs. Theropods were carnivores, but many evolved 
	  into omnivores and herbivores. 
			Theropods first appeared in the Carnian age of the late Triassic period. They had many diets, including carnivores, omnivores, and herbivores. 
	  All of the early fossil finds of these theropods showed that they were carnivores. Their fossilized teeth were sharp and serrated, which
	  is a common trait when it comes to eating other animals. 
			The first found non-carnivorous theropod was the therizinosaurus, which was referred to at the time as the segnosaurs. These theropods were found 
	  to be herbivores. The therizinosaurus had large abdomens, which were built to digest plants, small heads, and leaf shaped teeth. Over time 
	  archaeologists discovered that there were many more herbivores in the theropoda clade. 
			The Therizinosaurus was a Theropod in the late Cretaceous period. They lived in Asia and North America. The Therizinosaurus had a small head and 
	  leaf shaped teeth, as well as long necks and wrist bones similar to those of birds. They had wide hips, back pointed pubes bones, and 4 
	  widely spread toes. The first fossils of the therizinosaurus were found in 1948 in the gobi desert. 
	The Spinosaurus was a genus of theropod dinosaurs. Spinosaurus was named for its “sailed back” which was in the shape of a fan, made of tall 
	  vertebrae. They were named by a German paleontologist named Ernst Stromer in 1915. They discovered a partial skeleton in western Egypt, but 
	  it was destroyed in WW2. For decades, the Spinosaurus was known purely from Ernst’s descriptions, until later, in the 1990’s to 2000’s, when
	  they found additional fractions of the Spinosaurus. These were found in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. 
			The Spinosaurus was bigger that the Tyrannosaurus, and possessed a skull which measured up to around 6 feet long and a body length up to 59 feet. Their
	  heads closely resembled the one of a crocodile, being long and narrow, with nostrils near the eyes opposed to near the snoot.
			The allosaurus was alive in the Late Jurassic Epoch. Allosaurus means “different lizard” since when they first discovered them, they had unique 
	  (at the time) concave vertebrae. They were discovered in 1877 by paleontologist Othneil Charels Marsh. The allosaurus was carnivorous, which 
	  you can tell by their sharp serrated teeth, and their three large claws on their hands. The allosaurus was known to eat large herbivores, 
	  which we can tell from the bite marks in these dinosaur’s fossils. The allosaurus had large sharp teeth and powerful jaws, which isn’t much of
	  a surprise for one of the most predatory theropods of the Jurassic Period.
